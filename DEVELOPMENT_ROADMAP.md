## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
```
barnaby/
├── backend/           # Rust server
├── satellite/         # Raspberry Pi client
├── web-ui/           # Flutter web admin
├── mobile-app/       # Flutter mobile app
├── docs/             # Documentation
├── scripts/          # Deployment scripts
├── docker/           # Container configurations
└── tests/            # Integration tests
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature branch workflow
git checkout -b feature/stt-integration
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: add whisper STT integration"
git push origin feature/stt-integration
# Create PR for review
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Each component (auth, STT, TTS, etc.)
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests:** Full voice command pipeline
- **Performance Tests:** Audio processing latency and throughput

### Monitoring & Debugging
```rust
// Structured logging
use tracing::{info, warn, error, instrument};

#[instrument]
async fn process_audio(audio_data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<String> {
    info!("Processing audio chunk of {} bytes", audio_data.len());
    // ... processing logic ...
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **STT Accuracy:** Test multiple models, implement confidence thresholds
2. **Audio Latency:** Optimize streaming and processing pipeline
3. **Raspberry Pi Performance:** Profile and optimize satellite code
4. **Network Reliability:** Implement robust reconnection logic

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep:** Stick to MVP for each phase
2. **Integration Complexity:** Test components independently first
3. **Performance Issues:** Profile early and often
4. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security reviews

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success:
- Backend processes 95%+ of audio requests successfully
- Authentication system handles 1000+ concurrent users
- Response time < 2 seconds for simple commands

### Phase 2 Success:
- Satellite uptime > 99%
- Wake word detection accuracy > 90%
- Audio streaming latency < 500ms

### Phase 3 Success:
- Web UI loads in < 3 seconds
- Mobile app works on Android 8+ and iOS 12+
- Real-time updates have < 1 second delay

### Overall Success:
- Complete voice command pipeline works end-to-end
- System handles 10+ concurrent satellites
- 24/7 uptime with automatic recovery
- Extensible architecture for future features

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Focus on getting the core backend working
2. **Set up development environment** - Rust, Flutter, SQLite, MQTT broker
3. **Create initial project structure** - Use the provided templates
4. **Begin with authentication system** - Foundation for all other features
5. **Test early and often** - Don't wait until the end to integrate components

This roadmap provides a clear path from concept to production-ready voice assistant system. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring you have a working system at every milestone.
